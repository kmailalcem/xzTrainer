# xzTrainer
xzTrainer is an iOS timer app that times the execution stage of 3BLD with perfect memorization. 
xzTrainer supports all types of orientations, buffer pieces, and letter schemes. 
You can also customize your own style of cycle breaks, and the most common beginner methods have are listed separately.
However, you do have to use a method that solves the orientation and permutation at the same time, 
such as Old Pochmann for corners and M2 for edges.

## Installation
This app is currently under beta testing. 
In a week or so from today (Aug 7, 2018), xzTrainer will be submitted to the app store.
You would be able to download it directly from the app store.

## Set up
The default setups for the cube and the memo are 
- white top, green front
- DF for edge buffer, ULB for corner buffer
- Speffz letter scheme
with all memo options turned off.

You can change any of these settings by going to the main screen, clicking the upper right icon and go to settings.

## Why would I want such a timer?
xzTrainer will provide excellent separation of the memorization stage and the execution stage for 3BLD.
If you are new to any method of solving the Rubik's blindfolded, you may want to use this app to drill the execution 
and make sure that every aspect of this method became muscle memory.
There is no need to go through the work of memorizing the cube.
With this app, your practice routine for BLD execution is just like 3x3.

### But wouldn't this adversely affect my memorization speed?
If you are just looking to improve your memo, then yes, looking at the memo while solving the cube "blindfolded" isn't going to help you improve your memo.

But in almost every other aspect, this timer will provide excellent assistance.

If you are new to solving the cube blindfolded, it is the most frustrating experience to spend an eternity, revise several times making sure that the memorization is perfect, only to find out that you always forget to swap FU and BD when they appear on even numbered positions.

If you are looking to reduce pauses during execution, xzTrainer will allow you to think as much as you want without the risk of losing memory.

Maybe you are pretty confident with your memo, and are looking to increase your TPS. Then a timer like xzTrainer is your to-go choice.

Last but not least, fast execution is at the heart of fast memorization. If you want to reduce the number of revisions, you must be able to execute fast before you forget.

## A note on 3-style
You might be thinking that I should be ashamed not supporting much of 3-style when this is the ONLY execution method that top speedsolvers in BLD use.
To be honest, I do. 
However, as a newbie in the software industry, I'm taking advice from experienced engineers in not to be super ambitious about features in my apps, especially my first app for the App Store.
Despite this, in my opinion, the work done is way past a reasonable minimal viable product.

Right now, I belive that a timer like xzTrainer will definitely provide significant help to anyone looking to learn 3-style.
Practice drills against xzTrainer should probably come right after understanding commutators and getting enough sighted solves done.

The main problem with supporting 3-style is that there are so many features dedicated to 3-style that could be added.
I am, too, a cuber just getting familiar with more beginner-friendly methods like Advanced M2 and Old Pochmann, and am also looking to learn 3-style.
There are just so many features here and there that I could think of to improve the learning experience.

For this reason, if this app turns out to be popular and I have time (most likely During school breaks), there will be an update dedicated to 3-style. 

Stay tuned.
