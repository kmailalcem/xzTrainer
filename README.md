# xzTrainer
xzTrainer is an iOS timer app that times the execution stage of 3BLD with perfect memorization. 
xzTrainer supports all types of orientations, buffer pieces, and letter schemes. 
You can also customize your own style of cycle breaks, and the most common beginner methods have are listed separately.
However, you do have to use a method that solves the orientation and permutation at the same time, 
such as Old Pochmann for corners and M2 for edges.

## Installation
This app is currently under beta testing. 
In a week or so from today (Aug 7, 2018), xzTrainer will be submitted to the app store.
You would be able to download it directly from the app store.

## Set up
The default setups for the cube and the memo are 
- white top, green front
- DF for edge buffer, ULB for corner buffer
- Speffz letter scheme
with all memo options turned off.

You can change any of these settings by going to the main screen, clicking the upper right icon and go to settings.
